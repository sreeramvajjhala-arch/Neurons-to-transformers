# My Neural Networks Learning Journey

Just a personal repo where I'm documenting my learning path through neural networks and AI concepts. From basic fundamentals to understanding how LLMs actually work under the hood.

## üó∫Ô∏è What I'm Learning

### Understanding:
- **Neural Network Basics** - How they actually learn
- **The Math Behind Training** - Gradient descent, loss functions, backpropagation
- **AI/ML Fundamentals** - The difference between AI, ML, and deep learning
- RNNs & LSTMs (for sequential data)
- Transformer architecture (the foundation of modern LLMs)
- How LLMs like ChatGPT actually work
- Building simple AI agents

### The Learning Path I'm Following:
1. Basic neural networks & math
2. RNNs/LSTMs for sequence understanding  
3. Transformer architecture
4. How LLMs are built and trained
5. Building practical AI applications

## üéØ My Goal

I'm trying to actually understand how this stuff works rather than just using AI APIs. The end goal is to be able to build meaningful AI applications and understand what's happening under the hood.

## ü§î Why This Repo?

Mainly for my own reference and to track my understanding. If anyone else finds these notes helpful, that's great too!
